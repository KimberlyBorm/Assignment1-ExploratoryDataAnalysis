Assignment 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains my solutions for the "Exploratory Data Analysis" assignment from the Coursera Data Science Specialization. 
The goal of the assignment is to examine how household energy usage varied over a two‐day period in February 2007. 
The analysis uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository – specifically, 
the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set".

Repository File Structure
The top-level directory of this repository contains exactly eight files:

plot1.R and plot1.png
    plot1.R contains all the R code necessary to download (if needed), read, and process the data, and to generate Plot 1.
    plot1.png is the resulting plot that shows the histogram of Global Active Power.
    plot2.R and plot2.png

plot2.R constructs a time series (line) plot of Global Active Power over the specified two-day period.
    plot2.png is the corresponding PNG file.
    
plot3.R and plot3.png
    plot3.R generates a plot that displays the three sub-metering variables (Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2, Sub_metering_3) on one graph with a custom x-axis (showing Thu, Fri, Sat).
    plot3.png is the output image.

plot4.R and plot4.png
    plot4.R creates the final plot as described in the assignment instructions.
    plot4.png is the corresponding PNG file.
How to Reproduce the Analysis
Each R script is self-contained and includes code to:

Download and/or Read the Data:
The scripts check for and download the dataset if it's not already present.
They then read the data using read_delim() from the readr package and filter it to only include data for February 1 and 2, 2007.

Data Preprocessing:
The Date and Time columns are combined and converted to a proper date-time object (using as.POSIXct() or strptime()).
Missing values are handled appropriately (e.g., coded as ? in the raw data are set to NA).

Plot Construction:
The plots are built using base R plotting functions.
For example, Plot 1 is a histogram of Global Active Power, while Plot 3 overlays the energy sub-metering data on a 
single plot with a custom x-axis.
Each plot is saved as a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels. 
The code opens the PNG device with png(), creates the plot, and then closes the device with dev.off().

Custom Axis and Labeling:
The scripts include custom code to format the axes. For instance, the x-axis in Plot 3 is manually constructed 
to display "Thu", "Fri", and "Sat" at the start, middle, and end of the data range.

How to Use
Clone or Fork this Repository:
Ensure that you have cloned or forked the repository to your local machine.

Open the R Project:
If you're using RStudio, open the .Rproj file (if available) to set your working directory to the repository root. 
Otherwise, manually set your working directory to the repository folder.

Run the Scripts:
You can run each script (e.g., source("plot1.R")) to generate the corresponding PNG file. 
Each script is self-contained and should reproduce the plot when executed.

Dependencies
R version: 3.6 or later (or the version recommended by your course)
Packages:
readr
dplyr
Base R packages for plotting
(Make sure these packages are installed. You can install them using install.packages("readr") and install.packages("dplyr") if necessary.)

Additional Notes
The large dataset (household_power_consumption.txt) is not stored in the repository due to its size. 
The scripts are written to download and extract the data as needed.
If you encounter any issues with parsing the data, please check the comments within each script for troubleshooting hints.

Descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset:
Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
